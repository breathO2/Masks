# The Foegen Effect: Mask Mandates Increased COVID-19 Deaths by 51% or more compared to no mask mandates. Deep re-inhalation of droplets and virions caught on facemasks might make COVID-19 infection more likely or more severe.

# Using a mask for more than four hours per day "promotes facial alkalinization and inadvertently encourages dehydration, which in turn can enhance barrier breakdown and bacterial infection risk." Other reported adverse effects include: Increase in headaches, sweating, decreased cognitive precision, association with medical errors, interference with social learning in children, obscured nonverbal communication, distorted verbal speech, removal of visual cues, which is detrimental to people with hearing loss.

# There has been one large randomized controlled trial that specifically examined whether masks protect their wearers from the coronavirus.  This study found mask wearing “did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, the incidence of Sars-Cov-2-infection.”
